			'I ate the most delicious sushi ever here. Shian had explained the "All you can eat" in detail. Cost point about 12,50â‚¬ per person - depending on the exchange rate. The Fried sushi are so big that I had trouble getting them in my mouth and 8 of them. Every taste was recognizable and very well seasoned. The Nigiri have twice the fish on them than in Germany.',
